# MusicBox

A music box is a mechanical musical instrument that produces sounds by using a set of pins placed on a revolving cylinder or disc to pluck the tuned teeth of a metal comb. The music box has a quaint and nostalgic charm, and it often features a decorative case. I used data structures to implement this virtually.
